## Blockchain Web API

I implement this web-api as I learn about web development. So, it is not that fancy at the moment but I will keep working on this project. 

### The components I used: 
- The blockchain library I wrote and its API.
- Node.js express for client requests
- Ejs and CSS for frontend
- Json files for basic local databases
- MongoDB for express-session

### Web-api Example

## Usage
#### To start the server, just execute startServer.py with node modules.
