## Blockchain Web API

I develop this web-api as I learn about web development. It is a fullstack web app at this moment. Since I do not have any concern for design, I did not put too much effort on front-end.

### The components I used: 
- The blockchain library I wrote and its API.
- Node.js express for client requests
- React.js for front end
- MongoDB for blockchain database and express-session

### Web-api Example

- Execute startServer.py with node modules.

#### To start blockchain app:
- You can use "npm start" to run react app. For additional information you may read blockchain app readme file.
