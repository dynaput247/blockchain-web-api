To start the server, just execute startServer.py with node modules.

I implement this web-api as I learn about web development. So, it is quite beginner but I will keep working on this project. 

The components I used: 
- The blockchain library I wrote and its API.
- Node.js for backend
- Ejs and CSS for frontend
- Json for a basic local database
- MongoDB for express-session
