To start the server, just execute startServer.py with node modules.

I implement this web-api as I learn about web development. So, it is not that fancy at the moment but I will keep working on this project. 

The components I used: 
- The blockchain library I wrote and its API.
- Node.js express for backend
- Ejs and CSS for frontend
- Json for basic local databases
- MongoDB for express-session
